`Constant Time` 1 : no matter how many elements we are working with, the algorithm/operation will always take the same amount of time

`Logarithmic Time log(n)` : Searching operations are log(n)

`Linear Time n` : Iterating through all elements in a colection of data.

If you see a `for` loop sanning from '0' to 'array.length', it's 'n' or `linear time`

`n * log(n)` : Doubling the number of elements you are iterating over does not double the amount of work. Always assume that any `sorting` operation is `n*log(n)` 

`n^2` : Evrey element in a collection has to be compared to every other element, the handskake problem

`2^n` : If you add a single element to a collection, the processiong power required doubles
